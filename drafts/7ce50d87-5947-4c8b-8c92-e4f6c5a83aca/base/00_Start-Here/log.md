# Log

Append-only. One entry per change: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] <type> | <title>`, followed by the pages touched.

## [2026-11-04] setup | Dispatch board and wiki structure
- Turned `dispatch/wiki` into an Obsidian vault with the Dispatch board.
- Moved the concept docs: `README.md` → `04_Discovery/git-sync/README.md` (restores the `[[04_Discovery/git-sync/README]]` links); requirements, milestone plan and naming → `02_Product/`.
- Added [[index]], this log, [[Kai]] and the templates in `00_Start-Here/Templates/`.

## [2026-11-04] ticket | US00001 Tray icon and status window host
- Created [[Story - US00001 - Tray icon and status window host]] (Backlog, v0.3.0) from step 1 of [[Dispatch Mesh milestone plan#0.3 — tray application|0.3 — tray application]]; 6 open questions, including the toolkit and control-interface decisions the plan requires before 0.3.
- Listed in [[index]].

## [2026-11-04] refine | US00001 Tray icon and status window host
- Started refinement of [[Story - US00001 - Tray icon and status window host]]: Backlog → Refinement. Verified the context against the code (run loop and status derivation live in `src/main.rs`; three-value `status`; offline reads as needs attention; 0.2.x control interface not yet defined). Added a seventh open question (attention reason in the shell) and draft acceptance criteria.
